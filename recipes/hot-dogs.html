    <p>I know, I know. A recipe for hot dogs? Well, here it is. It may be simple, but it's good to have something at hand for those first-timers. And we are introducing a great tool, too: the air fryer.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>It does not get any easier than this</p>
    <ul>
        <li>nonstick cooking spray</li>
        <li>4 hot dogs</li>
        <li>4 hot dog buns</li>
        <li>4 slices cheddar cheese (optional)</li>
        <li>Mustard, ketchup or pickles for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>Now get your air fryer ready and let's do this</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Spray the basket of the air fryer with nonstick spray</li>
        <li>Add your 4 hot dogs to the air fryer basket, leaving some space between them</li>
        <li>Air fry at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Remove the hot dogs from the basket and put each one of them in a bun</li>
        <li>Place the assembled hot dogs back in the air fryer and cook for 90 seconds to toast the buns. This is the moment to add cheese if you want it to get melted over the hot dog</li>
        <li>Serve immediately topped with your favorite hot dog toppings like mustard, ketchup or pickles</li>
    </ol>
