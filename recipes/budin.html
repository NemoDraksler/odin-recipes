    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Budin is a delicious bread pudding made with day-old bread popular in Puerto Rico and many Latin American countries. The bread is intentionally smushed so it can dissolve into a cream and egg mixture. Sometimes, raisins are included for added flavor (though they are completely optional).</p>

    <p>Budin has added sugar at the bottom of the pan that eventually transforms into a delicious caramel sauce when you flip it after baking, giving it its traditional look. It doesn't have a standard shape, but it's usually either a square or circular shape.</p>

    <p>For this recipe you'll need the following ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2 or 3 cinnamon sticks</li>
        <li>15 whole cloves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon anise seed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>A half cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 pound loaf day-old bread</li>
        <li>4 cups evaporated milk</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>

        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
