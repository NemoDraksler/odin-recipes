    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Budin is a delicious bread pudding made with day-old bread popular in Puerto Rico and many Latin American countries. The bread is intentionally smushed so it can dissolve into a cream and egg mixture. Sometimes, raisins are included for added flavor (though they are completely optional).</p>

    <p>Budin has added sugar at the bottom of the pan that eventually transforms into a delicious caramel sauce when you flip it after baking, giving it its traditional look. It doesn't have a standard shape, but it's usually either a square or circular shape.</p>
