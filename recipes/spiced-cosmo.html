    <h1>Spiced cosmopolitan</h1>
    <p>A <strong>Spiced Cosmopolitan</strong> has all the same compponents of the original cosmo cocktail (vodka, Cointreau and lime juice) but with something extra added.</p>

    <p>The simple addition of falernum, a rich, spiced liqueur from Barbados with the flavors of allspice, cinnamon, clove, ginger, nutmeg, and a hint of almond, transforms the classic cosmo into the kind of sophisticated cocktail you can serve at an autumn dinner party or sip while cozying up to the firepit on a cool night.</p>
